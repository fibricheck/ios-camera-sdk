# FibriCheck iOS Camera SDK
The iOS Camera SDK allows developers to integrate FibriCheck's heart rhythm analysis technology into their own application. The SDK interfaces with the smartphone's camera and generates a raw PPG signal and a rough heartrate estimation in beats per minute.

## How to include 
To include the SDK in your project, follow these instructions:

### Swift Package Manager

1. Open your Swift project
2. Go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
3. In the "Choose Package Repository" dialog, enter the URL of this repository (`https://github.com/fibricheck/ios-camera-sdk`)
4. Select the version or branch of the library you want to use
5. Choose the target where you want to add the library and click Finish

### CocoaPods
1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory
2. Run the command `pod init` to create a Podfile
3. Open the Podfile with a text editor
4. Add the following line to the Podfile: `pod 'FibriCheckCameraSDK', :git => 'git@github.com:fibricheck/ios-camera-sdk.git', :tag => 'v0.1.1'`. Verify that you're pointing to the correct version.
5. Save and close the Podfile
6. Run the command `pod install` to download and install the library
7. Open the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods and start using the library in your Swift project
